Wikihub
=======

Wikihub is a small library that allows GitHub to be used as a wiki. It provides two methods, `load` which loads the text from a file on GitHub and `save` which commits changes to a file, creating a fork for the repository if necessary, and submits a pull request to the repo's origin.

Usage
-----

Copy the [`wikihub.min.js`](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki-hub/wiki-hub/master/dist/wikihub.min.js) file from the dist folder into your project. This exposes the `wikihub` object globally.

### Load

``` javascript
wikihub
  .load({
    token: 'h38d8h48fj49fji39903kfg84hhf84994jff8940',
    owner: 'jake-cool-user',
    repo: 'awesome-wiki',
    branch: 'master',
    path: '_posts/2015-08-01-whatever-happened-happened.md'
  })
  .then(function(text) {
    /* ...do something with text */
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    /* ...something went wrong */
  });
```

### Save

``` javascript
wikihub
  .save({
    token: 'h38d8h48fj49fji39903kfg84hhf84994jff8940',
    owner: 'jake-cool-user',
    repo: 'awesome-wiki',
    branch: 'master',
    path: '_posts/2015-08-01-whatever-happened-happened.md',
    text: 'This is what this post should really be about.'
  })
  .then(function(pull) {
    /* ...changes have been commited */
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    /* ...something went wrong */
  });
```

The following are optional parameters:

* `message` (defaults to "Wikihub changes...") is the commit message for this save.
* `forkBranch` (defaults to "wikihub") is the branch on the user's fork that the commit will be saved to.
* `title` (defaults to "Wikihub Changes") is the title of the pull request. Only used when the pull request is made and not changed with subsequent commits.
* `body` (defaults to "Automatically generated by wikihub") is the body of the pull request. Also only used when the pull request is made and not changed with subsequent commits.

### Token

Wikihub uses an oAuth token to authenticate with GitHub. This can either be created using [oAuth web flow](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow) or [through Github's website](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/#creating-a-token).
